1. It is much better to use prime numbers because using composite numbers with a lot of factors mean that there will be a much longer list of inputs that will give 0 as an answer. For example 
10 mod 4 = 2
20 mod 4 = 0
30 mod 4 = 2
40 mod 4 = 0
50 mod 4 = 2 
This means that a lot of values will return the same output and this is not ideal because then things cannot be put in individual spots. If it is prime, there is much more output variation. 
10 mod 7 = 3
20 mod 7 = 6
30 mod 7 = 2
40 mod 7 = 4
50 mod 7 = 1


2. Is is good in the sense that it is a prime number, however the prime number 599 should be even larger, because larger prime numbers will allow for more possible table values, and 599 will only allow for 599 table values.

3. Load factor refers to how much of the array can be full before the array needs to be rehashed. This is usually set to 75%. Once the load capacity is reached the array doubles in size.  h & (length-1) is used to calculate the index of the hash value. h is the length of the Hash Map and length is the number of buckets currently In the array. 

(Manipulate the int values of the chars into a big int) % (medium sized prime int) = output int
